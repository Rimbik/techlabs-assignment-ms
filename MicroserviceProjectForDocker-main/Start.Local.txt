RUN APPS LOCALLY 
===================
iNFRA: VS 2022 Community, .Net core 6, c#
-----------------------------------------

The .net solution is configured to launch all MicroServide App parallay.
They will be launched togther and you can access anyone using opened swagger url in browser

How to Run on Swagger:
1: Build and start (ctrl+f5) the .net solution or run from vs code
2: All 4 borwsers will open
	
	SLNO	API Name				Port	url
	==========================================================================
	1		eventbus-api			3005	http://localhost:3005/swagger/index.html
	2		blogpost-api			3005	http://localhost:3001/swagger/index.html
	3		blogcomment-api			3005	http://localhost:3002/swagger/index.html
	4		queryms-api				3005	http://localhost:3003/swagger/index.html

One shuld be able to access all the above url after startig the app using Ctrl+f5 in vs

3: 
	A) 
	Get ALL BLOGs
	---------------
	Go to url query-ms api: http://localhost:3003/swagger/index.html
	try the Get() API to see if any Blog is available- initially its blank
	
	Get URL:
	http://localhost:3003/api/QueryService
	
	B) 
	CREATE A BLOG
	--------------
	Go to Blog Port API with : http://localhost:3001/swagger/index.html
	Try the Post Action: and set the json as below
	
	JSON:
	{
		"blogID": "MyBlog-1",
		"blogMessage": "This is my Blog Header - My Blog1",
		"comments": [
			"string"
		]
	}

	you shoudl get succss, vaidate it by step:A above

	C) 
	Post Comment on existing BLOG
	------------------------------
	Go to url of Blogcomment-api: http://localhost:3002/swagger/index.html
	Select the default PUT action in swagger

	with JSON: 
	{
		"blogID": "MyBlog-1",
		"blogMessage": "string",
		"comments": [
			"Comment for MyBlog-1"
		]
	}

	** note: blogID have to match that you created earlier as Pimary key

	Now you caN GO to queryms-api: as step (A) and fire Get() to see latest blog status,
	you should see all udates in that


	Some Issue: ****
	Dnt use POST Action in Blogcomment-api to place any comment in exiswting blog,
	use PUT instead.

	entbus-api: is used only to accept / return responses, Do not use it APIs unnecesarily as
	
	CQRS style: (under eventbus-api) : It uses inmemory data storage and rerunninf the app will loose data
	: queryms-api is there for any query
	: blogpos-api and blogcomment-api is there for Commands


	***
	My next action will be ataching postman scripts for ease, instead of swagger url

	
	Few Notes:
	: Make sure docker does not strat automattically on application run/start
	  this .net solution also embedds docker based approach , so to run locally I have provission for all
	  like:
			run Locally:   with port 3000*
			run in Docker: with port 4000*
			run in k8s:    with port 5000*	---> Technically 30000*

	 So that we can test all at the same time
	 But at this moment focus on 3000 ports that are local machine

	 For that: go to VS > Tools > Settings > Container Menu
	 Make sure all docker related stuffs are Never/Disabled
	 When it is time for docker , we will create image and container from outside command

	  Enough Lecture, lets run......

	Enjoy... and for any issue mail me: rimbik@gmail.com
