Dear Sir...

I have created the Lab using vs and c#, and not able to create the UI using react.
However each API is testable from its Swagger based URL and a detailes instruction on test is given in file

[The uploaded lab is with Docker + k8s]

Start.Docker.txt
Start.k8s.txt
Start.Local.txt

These are the files on how to run them from each env.

Known Issue:
k8s: Unable to run app from krs minikube IP (nodeport not accessible)

If there is any help, will be appreciated..
At this moment minikube IP is not browsable....
